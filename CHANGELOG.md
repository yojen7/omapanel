# Changelog

All notable changes to OmaPanel are documented here.

## Unreleased

## 1.10.0

- Split item spacing between adjacent click targets so the visual gaps no
  longer create dead pointer areas.
- Add an optional item corner-radius setting with theme fallback and square
  corners at zero.
- Add independent Normal, Hover, and Active foreground opacity controls that
  affect both labels and application icons.
- Add a General setting that inverts application icon colors while preserving
  transparency.
- Cycle focus through matching pinned windows or same-workspace running
  windows when scrolling a multi-window taskbar group.
- Normalize wheel and touchpad deltas and wrap focus at group boundaries.
- Focus the hovered chip first when entering an inactive group, and keep
  one-window groups focused instead of passing their wheel event to the bar.

## 1.9.1

- Treat Hyprland window titles and application names as plain text so crafted
  titles cannot trigger QML AutoText / rich-text resource loads (including bar
  tooltips).
- Cap untrusted titles, classes, launch strings, and icon values; reject remote
  icon schemes and non-local `file://` URLs.
- Validate Hyprland window addresses as hex before focus/close dispatch.
- Reject oversized or nested-quantifier class regexes (`match`,
  `excludedClasses`).
- Prefer a pinned app's `desktopId` for New Window / desktop actions, and only
  look up desktop entries for plausible app IDs.
- When a pin has `desktopId`, require the window's resolved desktop entry to
  match before treating it as that pinned app.

## 1.9.0

- Adopted the permanent plugin ID `atagulalan.omapanel` to match the publisher
  namespace and product name.
- Aligned author metadata with the publisher namespace and added a marketplace
  preview image.

## 1.8.0

- Renamed the user-facing plugin and settings panel to OmaPanel.
- Split settings into General, Layout, and Appearance tabs.
- Added a manifest-backed Reset defaults action.
- Moved the settings gear to the upper-right corner of the context-menu header.
- Placed Close N Windows above Close Window.
- Organized Normal, Hover, and Active appearance settings into three columns.
- Added background and font-weight controls for all three visual states.
- Removed the active-background mode selector; a non-empty active background
  color now enables the fill automatically.
- Fixed live switching for Top and Dot indicators.
- Removed opacity reduction from closed pinned applications.
- Updated default size, spacing, and separator values.

## 1.7.3

- Changed eight-digit color input to `#RRGGBBAA` and converted values to Qt's
  internal alpha-first format before assignment.
- Unified active and hover backgrounds in one drawing layer.
- Ensured hover replaces the active background instead of blending with it.

## 1.7.1

- Separated active-background and pointer-hover color resolution.
- Made Hover active mode derive its fill from the active foreground.

## 1.6.0

- Added controls for behavior, layout, colors, typography, indicators,
  separators, and filters.
- Persisted form changes immediately with `updateEntryInline()`.

## 1.5.0

- Added independent active foreground and background behavior.
- Added None, Hover, and Custom active-background modes.
- Allowed active state to remain visible without an indicator.

## 1.4.2

- Kept the hover surface fully visible while closed pinned content was dimmed.

## 1.4.1

- Added item spacing, padding, icon-size, and font-size settings.
- Added normal and active color and font-weight settings.
- Added indicator style, color, thickness, length, size, and margin settings.

## 1.1.0
